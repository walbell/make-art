    "description": "Welcome to your first day! Before you set out from the lodge, your campsite sign needs a design. Be creative! Use a crazy color scheme, or show what you want to do at camp.  \nIn the Pacific Northwest of the United States, indigenous peoples carved Totem Poles to tell the stories of their families and cultures. These beautiful sculptures are carved into trees and often feature characters and events from legends. You can search the internet for images of Totem Poles for inspiration.",
