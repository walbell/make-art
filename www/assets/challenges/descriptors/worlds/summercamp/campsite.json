    "description": "Time to find a clearing to set up camp. The most important thing to look for when searching for an optimal campsite is flat ground. If possible, keep your campsite close to a water source. This will make cooking and cleanup much easier. Finally, make sure to be surrounded by trees, as they are a great source of kindling and will provide protection from the sun.  \nYour friends will want to see what your campsite looks like, so once you have one, draw it! You can use code to set the scene for where you are staying for the next two weeks.",
