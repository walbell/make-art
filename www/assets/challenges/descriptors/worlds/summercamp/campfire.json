    "description": "Time to get a fire going. In the wilderness, this very well might be your only source of light, and heat. Burning at over a thousand degrees fahrenheit, this will be sure to keep you warm, and could keep you fed too! Meats, vegetables, and marshmallows can all be cooked over the open flame with the help of sharpened sticks.  \nMost fires are built with wood logs, but yours is going to be built with code and a “loop.” As your fire grows upwards its colour changes into a deep shade of orange as the oxygen it is burning starts to cools down. Your code will produce hundreds of colours with just a few lines of code.",
