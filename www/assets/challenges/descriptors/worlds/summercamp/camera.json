    "description": "Back in the 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! With annoyingly long exposure hours, photographing people with a nice smile was not really possible. Why? Try and hold a convincing smile while staying perfectly still for hours and you will get your answer. Today, the number of photographs clicked every two minutes is same as the number of photographs clicked by mankind in 1800s.",
